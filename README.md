beginning of my passion for using node and related modules.
was shown this during my work experience and in my spare time developed these websites to further my understanding. 

went to my co-worker at the time and he happily showed me how to further improve my code and taught me how to deploy these on the Heroku cloud platform.


this was further developed from my 'webcrawler' repo where i created the data scraper for amazon site and developed into a proper API for website use
